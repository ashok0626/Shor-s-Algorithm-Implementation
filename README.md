# SSE_Project

Here dhoni.py is the message sender (client)

and virat.py is actual receiver  (server)
and rohit.py is attacker         (server)

First run the virat.py and rohit.py in separate terminals

$ python3 virat.py

$ python3 rohit.py

Now run the dhoni.py in another terminal 

$ python3 dhoni.py

Send the required message that you want to send

**************************Shor Algorithm************************************

For running shor algorithm look at the rohit.py code at the end which is in the comments
Run that entire code in google colab with low values of n (higher values timeout,not capable)
